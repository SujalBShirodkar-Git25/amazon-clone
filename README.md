## https://sujalbshirodkar-git25.github.io/amazon-clone/
Developed a fully functional Amazon clone with multiple interactive pages — including homepage, checkout, orders, and order tracking — styled to closely match the real Amazon interface.
Implemented advanced front-end features using JavaScript modules, OOP principles (classes & inheritance), and the MVC architecture to manage rendering and business logic. Used LocalStorage for cart and order persistence, and Day.js for time-related features.
Integrated data fetching from a mock backend and applied unit testing with Jasmine to ensure component reliability.
